# Space_Invader
2D Game "Old memo"

This game is based on 2d old games like super mario but its an copy of space invader as a begineer programmer.
I've created this game watching some tutorials and codes and this game was written in Python version 3.
Using Pygame  , Math, Random, Time module
You can directly donwload Game file based on your system or can copy the code manually and create your own game using your ideas.
